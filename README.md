# Gender Classification

### In this project you will implement a Deep learning model aiming at classifying a binary or multi-class dataset.

### Improve the modelâ€™s layers to fit well in dataset and get the high performance.

1. Preparing the dataset(preprocessing if needed)
2. Choosing the most suitable model for the problem (you can do that by searching similar problems).
3. Training & Testing the model.
4. Modifying the neural network layers to improve efficiency (make sure no overfitting or underfitting happens).
5. Preparing presentation for your project, It will include:
- Introduction (the problem, idea).
- Dataset (number of rows, number of columns, target columns, features, the source of the data, training data and testing data).
- Data preprocessing (if needed).
- Models (the reason of choosing it & modification made in it).
- Results (table) & Conclusion
